     <b><i><u>HTML</u></i></b>
     The <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to
     be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as <i>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</i>
     and scripting languages such as <strike>JavaScript.</strike>
     Web browsers receive <small>HTML</small> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
     into multimedia web pages. <big>HTML</big> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
     included cues for the appearance of the document.
